Welcome to the new NASMAT documentation site.  This site launches
concurrently with the public release of NASMAT 3.1. The goal is to
provide more efficient dissemination of NASMAT documentation and
publications.

In building this site, the NASMAT team strives to:

-   Advance the technical disciplines enabled my multi-scale modeling
-   Provide tutorials and working examples to enable adoption of
    multi-scale methods
-   Ease the adoption of NASMAT in research and applied engineering
-   To support a variety of audiences, from engineering students to
    seasoned researchers
-   To be clear, concise, accurate, comprehensive, and accessible

The NASMAT team can be reached at nasmat@lists.nasa.gov.
